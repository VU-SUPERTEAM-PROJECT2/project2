Project Overview

I Choose Brew is a fun full-stack web application about beer. The application allows users to search for breweries within their zip code & create a user profile which matches them with a beer they have never tried before & a pokemon. The application was made by four students in the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp over a two week period of time.
